# Golang Study projects

In this repo I am saving some simple projects I'm creating with my studies with the Golang programming language.

- SimpleWebserver: A simple API server in GoLang.
- GoMovies: A CRUD using memory to save data.
- GoBooks: A CRUD using PostgreSQL as database to save the data and Docker to launch the database.
